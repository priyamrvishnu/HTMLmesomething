          Introduction
      </h2>

      <P>
        My mother was identified with hypothyroidism at the age of 49. I had no idea of what was it at that time. 
        She already had joints pain in her knees and was having difficulties with doing daily household chors.
         So we consulted an ortho doctor for her joint pain and consulted endocrinologist for the thyroid problems. 
         But i had a feeling that it was not going good with these doctors and she often 
        had other problems such as shortness of breath. Now we started consulting a cardiologist too. 
        So with this condition suffering for the next 4 years, she took her last breath at the age of 53.
        <br>I felt like we missed to diagnose something which is the root of the diseases. 
        10 years later I started with the slight knee pain. I felt like something is returning back as 
        it did to my mother. So this time i decided to dig the root of the disease.
        <br>After careful investigations I found out that the root cause of these are the autoimmune response of the human
        system against its own system. It was rather shocking and felt that there is one basic problem for all the ailments occuring
        in the body. okay.. Let us now understand what is this autoimmune disease?

      </P>

      <h3>What is an autoimmune disease?</h3>
        <p>The mechanism of protecting against a disease within the 
            organism is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"> 
            immune system</a> of the body. The immune system should identify the foreign objects such as pathogens, 
            viruses and worms and differentiate between its own healthy tissues.The autoimmune diseases occur when the 
            system is not able to differentiate the foreign pathogens and its own healthy tissues. 
            As a result the immune system mistakenly attacks its own body leading to autoimmune diseases.

        <p>So, Instead of consulting diffeernt doctors for the one root problem we should find the solution which would cure 
            the root problem. Unfortunately, Allopathic medications is not possible to exactly diagnose the cause of the autoimmne disease.
            Only holistic medications which have been followed for years has the remedy to rejuvenate the human system. The nature has 
            the ability to enchance the survival of any species in the world. The only thing we need to do is to find out in what way are the 
            we supposed to use the herbal medicines.<br>There are nearly more than 100 diseases identified as they belong to the 
            autoimmune disorder of the human body. The commonly found diseases are listed below:

    <h2>
        Causes
    </h2>
    <p>Doctors donot know what causes the immune system misfire. Yet some people are more likely to get an autoimmune disease 
        than others. <br>Women get autoimmune diseases at a rate of about 2 to 1 compared to men about 6.4 percent of women vs. 2.7
         percent of men. Often the disease starts during a woman's childbearing years (ages 14 to 44). <br>Some autoimmune 
         diseases are more common in certain ethnic groups. For example, lupus affects more African-American and Hispanic 
         people than Caucasians. <br>Certain autoimmune diseases, like multiple sclerosis and lupus, run in families. Not every 
         family member will necessarily have the same disease, but they inherit a susceptibility to an autoimmune condition.<br>
         Because the incidence of autoimmune diseases is rising, researchers suspect environmental factors like infections and 
         exposures to chemicals or solvents might also be involved.<br> A “Western” diet is another suspected trigger. 
         Eating high-fat, high-sugar, and highly processed foods is linked to inflammation, which might set off an immune 
         response. However, this has not been proven. <br>Another theory is called the hygiene hypothesis. Because of vaccines 
         and antiseptics, children today are not exposed to as many germs as they were in the past. The lack of exposure could 
         make their immune system overreact to harmless substances.</p>
