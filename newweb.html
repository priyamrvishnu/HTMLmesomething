          Autoimmune diseases and herbal remedies
      </h1>

      <P>
        My mother was identified with hypothyroidism at the age of 49. I had no idea of what was it at that time. 
        She already had joints pain in her knees and was having difficulties with doing daily household chors.
         So we consulted an ortho doctor for her joint pain and consulted endocrinologist for the thyroid problems. 
         But i had a feeling that it was not going good with these doctors and she often 
        had other problems such as shortness of breath. Now we started consulting a cardiologist too. 
        So with this condition suffering for the next 4 years, she took her last breath at the age of 53.
        <br>I felt like we missed to diagnose something which is the root of the diseases. 
        10 years later I started with the slight knee pain. I felt like something is returning back as 
        it did to my mother. So this time i decided to dig the root of the disease.
        <br>As an initial step I consulted and ortho doctor and he suggested me some medicines and advised me to 
        loose weight.

      <h3>What is an autoimmune disease?</h3>
        <p>The mechanism of protecting against a disease within the 
            organism is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"> 
            immune system</a> of the body. The immune system should identify the foreign objects such as pathogens, 
            viruses and worms and differentiate between its own healthy tissues.

            <br>The autoimmune diseases occur when the system is not able to differentiate the foreign pathogens and 
            its own healthy 
                tissues. As a result the immune system mistakenly attacks its own body leading to autoimmune diseases.
